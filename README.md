# Sudoku-Solver-Python
Final Project for Data Structures - 2015

Built by Jordan Huddleston and Taylor Scafe

This program was built to solve a Sudoku Puzzle.

This project was not fully functioning when presented but it was very close.

I made a patch on ([10/10/2017](https://github.com/robosheep95/Sudoku-Solver-Python/commit/11bab238b18f5ae6084a7e8ef77d734a19acbd33)) that should allow it to solve all puzzles

Currently, the interface is horrable/non-existent and needs a complete overhaul.
